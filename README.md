This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

What is this project about. Ok to enrich here or the section above it with an image. 

Once this repo has been setup on Codacy by the TTL, replace the above badge with the actual one from the Codacy dashboard, and add the code coverage badge as well. This is mandatory

This is a simple python starter repo template for setting up your project. The setup contains:

- install: poetry via pip. poetry is a dependecy manager.

- poetry: configuration in pyproject.toml

- flake8: for linting and formatting

## Why

Talk about what problem this solves, what SDG(s) and SGD targets it addresses and why these are important

## Usage

How would someone use what you have built, include URLs to the deployed app, service e.t.c when you have it setup

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

Open `[http://localhost:3000]` to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the 
commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run lint`

**Note: this operation need to install eslint like this: npm install eslint**

To standardize code syntax and uniform compliance with best pratices, this command allows us in development mode to check the status of our code. If you are on VSCode, you can fly by installing the eslint extension. This will automatically read your .eslintrc file and indicate the errors if there are problems in the code.

## Authors

List the team behind this project. Their names linked to their Github, LinkedIn, or Twitter accounts should siffice. Ok to signify the role they play in the project, including the TTL and mentor

## Contributing

If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)

## Acknowledgements
